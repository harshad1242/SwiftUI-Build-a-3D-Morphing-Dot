# 3D Morphing Particle System

A beautiful and interactive 3D particle system visualization built with SwiftUI and SceneKit. This project demonstrates advanced 3D graphics techniques with dynamic particle animations and morphing shapes.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ **Dynamic Particle System**
  - 2000+ particles with random colors
  - Continuous color transitions
  - Varying particle sizes
  - Emission glow effects

- ðŸ”„ **Complex Animations**
  - Multi-axis rotation (X, Y, Z)
  - Individual particle rotation
  - Smooth shape morphing
  - Subtle pulsing effect

- ðŸŽ¯ **Interactive Shapes**
  - Sphere
  - Cube
  - Torus
  - Smooth transitions between shapes

- ðŸ’¡ **Lighting Effects**
  - Ambient lighting
  - Directional lighting
  - Specular highlights
  - Particle emission glow

## Requirements

- iOS 18.0+
- Xcode 16.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3dMorphing.git
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
cd 3dMorphing
open 3dMorphing.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run the project on your iOS device or simulator.

## Usage

- The particle system automatically starts with a rotating torus shape
- Use the camera controls to view the particles from different angles
- The particles continuously change colors and rotate in 3D space
- The entire system pulses gently to create a dynamic effect

## Technical Details

The project uses several advanced techniques:

- SceneKit for 3D rendering
- CABasicAnimation for smooth transitions
- Custom particle positioning algorithms
- Dynamic color generation
- Multi-threaded animation handling
